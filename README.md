# War of the Vikings Launch Fix
Launch War of the Vikings game without backend.
- Everything's unlocked.
- Training works.
- Multiplayer works. Select Join or Host(You can change map and game mode).
## Using
> [!WARNING]
> Use at your own risk.
- Download [latest release](https://github.com/angaityel/wotv-re/releases)
- Unpack files from bundle.zip to bundle folder (e.g. C:\Program Files (x86)\Steam\steamapps\common\War of the Vikings\bundle\\)
- In game folder: Shift + Right-click on wotv.exe - select Copy as path
- Go to Steam - Library - right click War of the Vikings - Properties - LAUNCH OPTIONS
- Paste your copied path and add %command% at the end after space
- "your path to wotv.exe" %command%

Examples of how it should look like:
```
"C:\Program Files (x86)\Steam\steamapps\common\War of the Vikings\wotv.exe" %command%
"D:\Games\SteamLibrary\steamapps\common\War of the Vikings\wotv.exe" %command%
```
- Launch game

## Alternative method for Linux (Works for Windows too)

- Download [latest release](https://github.com/angaityel/wotv-re/releases)
- Unpack files from bundle.zip to bundle folder
- Delete run_game.exe
- Make copy of wotv.exe
- Rename copy to run_game.exe
- Run it with Proton Experimental

## Additional launch options
Lobby name and player limit:
- -lobbyname "server name": custom names for servers.
- -lobbymaxmembers 256: server player limit, default value without command is 256.
- -timelimit 123456: round time in seconds.
- -winscore 123: round win score (up to 1000).

And lobby visibility:
- -lobbyprivate: private server (probably useless, invites don't seem to work).
- -lobbyfriends: friends only server (only friends can see or join? Not tested).

You can add these commands to game launch options after %command%.

Should look something like this:
```
"your path to wotv.exe" %command% -lobbyname "my super-duper server" -lobbymaxmembers 8
```
## Hosting games
Create a .bat file in game folder with:
```
wotv.exe -bundle-dir bundle -autohost -network-hash "" -no-rendering -level Forest -game-mode tdm
```
It's the same as hosting in-game, only without rendering.

This should prevent game from crashing with 5+ players, but host won't be able to play.

For map rotation change map_rotation.ini and add command to launch options:
```
-ini launch_server_settings
```

First map in map_rotation.ini must be specified in launch options. For example:
```
maps = [
	{
		game_mode = "tdm"
		level = "Monastery"
		game_mode_size = 64
		time_limit = 1234
		win_score = 100
	}
	{
	...
```
Then launch options should look like this:
```
wotv.exe -bundle-dir bundle -autohost -network-hash "" -no-rendering -level Monastery -game-mode tdm -timelimit 1234 -lobbyname "server name" -ini launch_server_settings
```

Maps and available modes:
```
Cliff - tdm, con, battle, arena, ass
Forest - tdm, con, battle, ass
Docks - tdm, con, battle, arena, headhunter
Gauntlet - tdm, arena
Monastery - tdm, arena
